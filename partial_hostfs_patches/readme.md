# Partial Host Filesystem Patches

These patches mostly separate a game from its original disc image, but still need access to it or a different disc image in order to work properly.

Create a folder in your PCSX2 install directory and name it "hostfs_games", then put the original disc image in there. This will ensure that the original disc image is not scanned by the games list and won't show up there:

<img width="918" height="439" alt="Capture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f43c4ac-3c2f-4832-85cd-5428a2ee4353" />

In the HostFS-patched game's custom configuration, set the Disc Path to the original disc image which you stored in the "hostfs_games" folder:

<img width="1457" height="559" alt="Capture2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db0799b6-5255-4d59-8349-0151496cd9a4" />

This will result in the game reading from the patched paths where applicable, but it'll still be able to read from a disc image where it needs to.
