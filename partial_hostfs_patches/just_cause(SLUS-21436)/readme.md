# Just Cause (SLUS-21436)

This patch separates the game's "ARCHIVES" and "PS2/SFX/" directories from the disc image, but it still needs it present to load the IRX modules. While there's no notable loading time improvements, this will allow for easier file modding.

A pnach cheat file has beeen included with the executable's new CRC serial, and it contains the original built-in Widescreen and 60 FPS patches.
