# SnoCross 2 featuring Blair Morgan

This patch completely separates the game from its disc image. This massively improves loading times, and its completely loose filesystem makes this a mostly easy game to modify.

Credit goes to modeco80 for reverse-engineering the game's video-player system and making it load the "movies" directory from Host Filesystem.
