# The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius - Attack of the Twonkies

This is specifically for the European release of the game, and it completely separates it from its disc image. This is actually required to be able to play the game on PCSX2, as an unknown programming fault in either the game or PCSX2 itself cause constant lockups and hangs if run from its disc image.

Note that some people report that the patch doesn't work on case-sensitive filesystems as well as certain BIOS revisions, yet others, myself included, can't reproduce these issues.

Credit goes to modeco80 for reverse-engineering this title and finding a leftover native Host Filesystem reading mode.
